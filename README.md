# UK-Road-Accidents-Power-BI-Dashboard
UK Road Accident Analysis Using Power BI
Overview
This project provides an interactive Power BI dashboard for analyzing road accidents in the UK. The dashboard presents key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizations to gain insights into accident trends, severity, and contributing factors over time. It is designed to assist decision-makers, researchers, and policymakers in understanding road safety patterns.

Key Features
1. KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)
Casualties this year vs. last year: Overall number of casualties compared year-over-year.
Accidents this year vs. last year: Total accidents analyzed with a year-over-year comparison.
Fatal Casualties: Fatal incidents this year compared to last year.
Serious Casualties: Serious injuries analyzed year-over-year.
Slight Casualties: Casualties with minor injuries compared year-over-year.
2. Interactive Visualizations
Heatmap: Locations of casualties across the UK, with intensity highlighting accident-prone regions.
Donut Chart: Comparative analysis of rural and urban casualties.
Casualties by Road Type: Distribution of casualties based on different road classifications (e.g., motorways, residential streets).
Casualties by Year: Longitudinal view of accidents and casualty trends.
Casualties by Lighting Condition: Impact of lighting conditions (e.g., daylight, streetlight, or dark with no lighting).
Casualties by Vehicle Type: Classification of accidents by the types of vehicles involved.
3. Dynamic Filtering Options
Dropdown Slicers:
Weather Conditions: Filter data based on weather conditions like clear, rain, snow, or fog.
Road Surface Conditions: Analyze trends considering road surfaces such as dry, wet, or icy conditions.
Police Force: Filter data by police force areas to assess enforcement effectiveness or regional patterns.
Data Source
The dataset is sourced from the UK Department for Transport and includes details about road traffic accidents across various regions in the UK.

Technologies Used
Power BI Desktop: For creating interactive visualizations and dashboards.
Microsoft Excel: Used for initial data cleaning and preprocessing.
UK Geo-Coordinates Dataset: For visualizing location-based casualty data on a heatmap.
Dashboard Highlights
Key Questions Answered:
How have casualties and accidents changed compared to the previous year?
Which areas have the highest concentration of accidents?
What are the most common lighting and weather conditions during accidents?
How do accident trends differ between rural and urban regions?
What types of vehicles are most involved in accidents?
Examples of Insights:
Urban areas reported a higher percentage of slight injuries compared to rural areas.
The majority of serious casualties occurred in low-visibility conditions.
Motorways exhibited lower casualty rates per mile compared to residential roads.
How to Access

Future Enhancements
Integration with Real-Time Data: Use APIs for live traffic data.
Predictive Modeling: Integrate machine learning models to forecast accident-prone zones.
Regional Comparisons: Add comparative insights across different UK regions.
